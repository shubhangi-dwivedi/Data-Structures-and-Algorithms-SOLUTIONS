/*
Brief note about Question-

We have to return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)
Let's take an example not given in question -
poured = 4, query_row = 2, query_glass = 0

so the answer may be found out by this 
row 0                        4 (it fills in 1, so extra remains (4 - 1 = 3), now it divides it's half both sides so (3 / 2 = 1.5) each) 
row 1			       1.5	     1.5 (they keep 1 for themselves (1.5 - 1 = 0.5) and for remaining they divide by 2 i.e (0.5 / 2 = 0.25))
row 2             0.25     0.50       0.25
                   â†‘   "(0.25 + 0.25)"
				   
				   Arrow represents the required index we want,
				   so the answer is 0.25
